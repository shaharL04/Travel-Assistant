## PROMPT STRUCTURE

```
{{SYSTEM_PROMPT}}

PLANNING REQUEST: {{USER_MESSAGE}}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{{CONVERSATION_HISTORY}}

EXTERNAL DATA: {{EXTERNAL_DATA_JSON}}

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Analyze if this is a follow-up response to a previous question
- Check if the user's response is short (1-3 words) indicating a follow-up answer
- Determine if this is a new topic or continuation of previous discussion
- Reference previous preferences and constraints mentioned

ACCURACY VERIFICATION:
- Verify that all destinations mentioned are real and exist
- If external data is available, use it to confirm destination details
- If any destination is fictional or unknown, clearly state this
- Do NOT create plans for fictional places
- Offer real alternatives with similar characteristics

COMPLEX PLANNING CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS:
Let me think through this step by step:

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE PLANNING REQUEST
- What type of planning is needed? (multi-city, budget, seasonal, logistics)
- Is this a response to a previous question or a new request?
- What are the key constraints and requirements?
- What level of complexity is involved?
- Are all mentioned destinations real and verifiable?

STEP 2: EVALUATE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS
- Consider the planning scope and complexity
- Evaluate based on:
  * Multi-city coordination needs
  * Budget constraints and optimization
  * Seasonal factors and timing
  * Transportation and logistics
  * Accommodation requirements
  * Risk management needs
  * All destinations must be real and verifiable

STEP 3: STRUCTURE THE PLANNING FRAMEWORK
- Create a logical planning approach
- Consider:
  * Route optimization and sequencing
  * Budget allocation and cost management
  * Timeline and scheduling
  * Resource allocation
  * Contingency planning
  * All locations must be real and verifiable

STEP 4: DEVELOP SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
- Provide actionable planning steps
- Include:
  * Specific recommendations with reasoning
  * Cost estimates and budget breakdowns
  * Timeline and scheduling details
  * Alternative options and flexibility
  * Risk mitigation strategies
  * All recommendations must be based on real, existing places

STEP 5: PROVIDE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
- Clear next steps and action items
- Practical implementation advice
- Resource requirements and preparation
- Monitoring and adjustment strategies
- Success metrics and evaluation criteria

Please provide a comprehensive travel planning response with this structured approach:
