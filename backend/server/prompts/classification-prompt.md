## CLASSIFICATION RULES - CRITICAL DECISION MAKING

### **DESTINATION vs ITINERARY vs PLANNING - KEY DISTINCTIONS**

**Choose "destination" when:**
- User asks "where should I go?" or "recommend places"
- User wants location suggestions based on preferences
- User asks about specific destinations (is X good for Y?)
- User wants destination comparisons
- **Focus is on CHOOSING a location**

**Choose "itinerary" when:**
- User asks "what should I do?" or "plan my days"
- User wants daily schedules and activity planning
- User mentions specific timeframes (3 days, weekend, week)
- User wants to know what activities to do and when
- **Focus is on SCHEDULING activities within a destination**

**Choose "planning" when:**
- User asks "how do I plan?" or "coordinate my trip"
- User mentions multiple destinations or countries
- User wants logistics coordination (transportation, accommodation, budget)
- User asks about complex trip organization
- User wants risk management or strategic advice
- **Focus is on COORDINATING logistics across multiple elements**

### **COMPLEXITY INDICATORS**

**Low Complexity (destination, packing, general):**
- Single location or simple request
- Basic information needs
- Straightforward recommendations

**Medium Complexity (itinerary):**
- Daily scheduling and activity planning
- Time management within a destination
- Activity coordination and timing

**High Complexity (planning):**
- Multi-destination coordination
- Complex logistics and transportation
- Budget optimization and risk management
- Strategic decision-making
- Multiple constraint management

## DESTINATION EXTRACTION

Extract the destination mentioned in the message. The destination can be either a city+country combination or just a country.

### **DESTINATION EXTRACTION RULES**

#### **Primary Extraction Rules:**
- Look for city names, country names, or specific locations mentioned in the message
- **City + Country Format**: Extract as "City, Country" when both are mentioned
- **Country Only**: Extract as "Country" when only country is mentioned (no city)
- **City Only**: Try to infer the country from context, or return "none" if unclear
- For general travel questions without specific destinations, return "none"
- Handle variations in spelling and common abbreviations
- For multi-city requests, extract the primary destination or return "none"

#### **Advanced Extraction Techniques:**
- **City + Country Format**: "Paris, France", "Tokyo, Japan", "New York, USA"
- **Regional References**: "Tuscany, Italy", "Bali, Indonesia", "Kyoto, Japan"
- **Common Abbreviations**: "NYC, USA" (New York City), "LA, USA" (Los Angeles)
- **Alternative Names**: "Roma, Italy" (Rome), "München, Germany" (Munich)
- **Multi-word Cities**: "San Francisco, USA", "Buenos Aires, Argentina"

#### **Context-Based Extraction:**
- **Previous Conversation**: If user mentioned a destination earlier, use that context
- **Implicit References**: "the city" or "there" referring to previously mentioned places
- **Geographic Context**: "in Europe" + specific city = extract city + "Europe" as region
- **Cultural References**: "Japanese cities" + specific city = extract city + "Japan"

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Islands**: "Hawaii, USA", "Santorini, Greece", "Bali, Indonesia"
- **States/Provinces**: "California, USA", "Ontario, Canada", "Bavaria, Germany"
- **Multi-City Requests**: Extract primary destination or return "none"
- **Generic Regions**: "Europe", "Asia", "Caribbean" = return "none"
- **Fictional Places**: "Gotham City" = return "none" (not real)

#### **Extraction Examples:**

**Successful Extractions - City + Country:**
- "I want to visit Paris" → "Paris, France"
- "Tokyo is amazing" → "Tokyo, Japan"
- "Planning a trip to Rome" → "Rome, Italy"
- "What's it like in Barcelona?" → "Barcelona, Spain"
- "Tell me about Kyoto" → "Kyoto, Japan"
- "Planning for San Francisco" → "San Francisco, USA"

**Successful Extractions - Country Only:**
- "I want to visit Japan" → "Japan"
- "Planning a trip to France" → "France"
- "What's Italy like?" → "Italy"
- "Recommend destinations in Thailand" → "Thailand"
- "Planning for Australia" → "Australia"
- "What about Canada?" → "Canada"

**Failed Extractions (return "none"):**
- "Europe is beautiful" → "none" (only region)
- "Where should I go?" → "none" (no destination)
- "Plan a multi-city trip" → "none" (no specific destination)
- "What's the weather like?" → "none" (no destination)
- "Gotham City sounds fun" → "none" (fictional)

**Complex Cases:**
- "I want to visit both Paris and Rome" → "Paris, France" (primary destination)
- "Planning a trip through Europe" → "none" (no specific city)
- "What about cities in Japan?" → "Japan" (country mentioned)
- "Tokyo vs Osaka" → "Tokyo, Japan" (first mentioned city)

#### **Validation Requirements:**
- **Real Places Only**: Verify destination exists in real world
- **Current Names**: Use current official names (e.g., "Czech Republic" not "Czechoslovakia")
- **Standard Format**: Use "City, Country" for cities, "Country" for countries only
- **Consistent Spelling**: Use standard English spellings when possible
- **Context Accuracy**: Ensure extracted destination matches user's intent

#### **Common Destination Patterns:**
- **Direct Mention**: "I want to go to [City]" → "City, Country"
- **Direct Mention**: "I want to visit [Country]" → "Country"
- **Question Format**: "What's [City] like?" → "City, Country"
- **Question Format**: "What's [Country] like?" → "Country"
- **Planning Context**: "Planning a trip to [City]" → "City, Country"
- **Planning Context**: "Planning a trip to [Country]" → "Country"
- **Comparison**: "[City] vs [City]" → "City, Country"
- **Recommendation**: "Recommend [City]" → "City, Country"
- **Recommendation**: "Recommend [Country]" → "Country"
- **Validation**: "Is [City] good for [purpose]?" → "City, Country"
- **Validation**: "Is [Country] good for [purpose]?" → "Country"

#### **Error Prevention:**
- **Double-check spelling** of extracted city and country names
- **Verify country association** is correct for cities
- **Avoid assumptions** about regional relationships
- **Handle ambiguous cases** by returning "none"
- **Consider conversation context** for implicit references
- **Distinguish clearly** between city+country and country-only requests
