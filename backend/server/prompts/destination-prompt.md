CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS:
Let me think through this step by step:

1. ANALYZE THE REQUEST:
   - What type of destination recommendation is the user seeking?
   - Is this a response to a previous question or a new request?
   - What context do we have from previous messages?
   - Are all mentioned destinations real and verifiable?
   - What specific criteria are they looking for (budget, activities, season)?

2. EVALUATE DESTINATION OPTIONS:
   - Consider destinations that match the user's criteria
   - Evaluate based on:
     * Budget suitability and cost considerations
     * Seasonal appropriateness and weather conditions
     * Accessibility and transportation options
     * Cultural and personal interests mentioned
     * Safety and practical considerations
   - Verify each destination is real and exists
   - Cross-reference with external data when available

3. FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - What specific destinations best match their needs?
   - How can I make these recommendations actionable?
   - What unique aspects of each destination should I highlight?
   - What follow-up question would provide the most value?
   - Are all recommendations based on real, verifiable destinations?

4. PROVIDE RESPONSE:
   - Clear, structured destination recommendations
   - Specific details and reasoning for each suggestion
   - Practical considerations and tips
   - ONE focused follow-up question if needed
   - Clear acknowledgment if any destinations are fictional
